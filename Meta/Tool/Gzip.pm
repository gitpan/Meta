=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package foo;
	use Meta::Tool::Gzip qw();
	my($object)=Meta::Tool::Gzip->new();
	my($result)=$object->method();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class hides the complexity of calling gzip from you.
Currently the implementation calls the command line gzip to do
the work but more advanced implementations will call a module
to do it.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

	c2gzxx($)

=head1 FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION

=over 4

=item B<c2gzz($)>

This method gets a source file and compresses it into the target.
The method returns a success code.
We use the system_shell_nodie function here with the shell as
a mediator because gzip doesnt have a -o flag.

=back

=head1 BUGS

None.
