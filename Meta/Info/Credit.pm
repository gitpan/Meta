=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package foo;
	use Meta::Info::Credit qw();
	my($object)=Meta::Info::Credit->new();
	my($result)=$object->method();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Whenever a group of people collaborate on a work then each has
done many things in the package. Look at the Linux kernel for
instance - it has many contributors and each contributor contributed
many things to the package. The idea is that you will have a perl
object which can store all of that information - meaning many
authors and each has many contribution. What can you do with
it ? Well - you can maintain it in an XML file (which is
more robust than maintaining it in a text file) and then:
1. print it as a chapter in Docbook.
2. convert it into VCARD which you can import into your email
	client.
3. find out who did something (search).
4. print it in various formats for various purposes.
5. send test emails to those emails periodically to make
	sure that all the authors are responsive.
