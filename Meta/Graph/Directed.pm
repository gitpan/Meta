=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package foo;
	use Meta::Graph::Directed qw();
	my($object)=Meta::Graph::Directed->new();
	my($result)=$object->method();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is here to provide a place to add method to the Graph::Directed
module available from CPAN. I know that Graph::Directed looks pretty nice but
still if I need any convenience methods or maybe a small algorithm or two it
will be nice to add them at the graph level.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

	vertices_num($)
	edges_num($)
	get_single_succ($$)
	nodes_delete_all($)
	TEST($)

=head1 FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION

=over 4

=item B<vertices_num($)>

This method returns the number of vertices in the graph. It's true that the method
vertices in Graph returns this number if called in a scalar context but I hate having
methods behave differently in different contexes.

=item B<edges_num($)>

This method returns the number of edges in the graph.

=item B<get_single_succ($$)>

This method will retrieve the single successor node for a certain node
(will make sure that it has only 1 of those).

=item B<nodes_delete_all($)>

This method will delete all vertices and edges from the graph.

=item B<TEST($)>

Test suite for this module.
Currently it just constructs a graph and prints some statistics.
