PREFACE

This is a document which describes how to install the
module which you received this document with. This is a
quick intro and should probably work for most people most
of the time. If you have more specific requirements or you
encounter problems with the procedure please read the more
complete documentation on how to install modules from CPAN
which came with your perl distribution. On most systems
this is available by running "perldoc perlmodinstall".

------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES

Check that you have all the prerequisites installed.
You can find them in Makefile.PL listed in PREREQ_PM.
If you fail to install any of them then you will be
prompted for them again in the installation phase.

------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD INSTALLATION

On most systems, just do this from the command line:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

Please note that you'll need permission to write to the
standard installation directories; under Unix-like systems, this
often means that you must be logged in as "root". This comment
applies only to the "make install" command at the end. the first
two stages are better executed as a regular user for system
health reasons.

If you're on a non-Unix platform, you might be using 'dmake'
instead of 'make'.

The tests should all pass. I advise you not to install if any
of the tests fail - and this is especially true if you're
upgrading. It's your call.

------------------------------------------------------------
NON-STANDARD INSTALLATION

To install to a non-standard place (e.g., "/home/me/lib"), 
see the manual page for ExtUtils::MakeMaker, or try this:

	perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/me/lib
	make test
	make install

------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS

If you encounter any problems with the installation procedure
or in the testing phase please email the author. Patches,
enhancements and fixes will be received warmly.
